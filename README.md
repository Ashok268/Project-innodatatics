# Project-innodatatics : The Warrenty Claim Project
## Project Objective:
To predict whether the warranty claim filed by a customer is fraud or genuine.
### Description of theproject :
In this project I worked on the data of a Electronics company who sells TV and AC all over India. Using the tree-based models mentioned above I come up with more than 0.96 accuracy, so I considered them for my Model deployment, where I used the Flask module. And for showcasing my model I hosted my models using Heroku.
#### Methods and Algorithms:
Decission tree, XGBoost 0.90, CatBoost 0.19.1, Random Forest.

##### Tools and Techniques:
Python 3.6.5, Flask (deployment), Heroku (hosting).
